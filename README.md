# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques, we build and test a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews. We combine a concise API with a WebSocket server to build a realtime experience.

## Goal

Create a modern client application using the React view library.

## Functional Requeriments
- Development focuses on a single page application (SPA) called Interview Scheduler, built using React.

- Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database.

- The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.

- Jest tests are used through the development of the project.
